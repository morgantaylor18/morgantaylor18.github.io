								<h2>Interests</h2>
								<p> My very first career goal was to become an astrophysicist. Space has fascinated me since I was a kid and our limited knowledge on it was like unlimited investigating to me. After taking an Aerospace engineering class in high school, I loved anything flight related. </p>
								<p> I decided to major in Physics in undergrad, hoping a more broad major would allow me to explore more of my interests, and boy did it. During my time at Lewis & Clark College I added on a Mathematics major and nearly a computer science one. Some of my favorite courses were Advanced Electricity & Magnetism, Advanced Lab, AI and Machine Learning, Soft. Dev., and Real Analysis.</p>
								<p> I consider myself very new to computer science, taking my first CS course my sophomore year of college. I see this as an oppurtunity to keep learning. One of the things I love about computer science is how fast it is growing. Everyone always has to keep learning, so often the expert and the newbie are learning the same things. I am open to several fields in computer science
